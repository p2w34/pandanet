## **"Pandanet"** is the simplest possible, decentralized social network, similar to **X** (formerly known as **Twitter**).

The work presented here was heavily inspired by the [nostr protocol](https://github.com/nostr-protocol). While the nostr protocol is backed by some briliant ideas, as always, there is room for improvement. You can find my critiques at: [https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr/issues/130](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr/issues/130).

## **"Pandanet"** features.
- The ability to sign posts with MetaMask (including hardware wallets).
- Full ownership of the data and metadata: Users utilize their own Google accounts, and no other server-side software is required. Your posts are stored as files on your Google Drive, and your connections' metadata (the people in your network) is also stored on your Google Drive in the form of a database file (SQLite) protected by Google auth mechanism.
- A simple webpage (work in progress) known as **pandanet_url** serves as your **"Pandanet wall."** Here, you can create/edit posts and view the posts of your connections.

And... that's it!

## P.S.
The idea is to demonstrate that the future of decentralized networks lies in their simplicity. The prediction is that, one day, thanks to AI, every Internet user will:
- Sign the stuff their post with hardware wallets, making it easy to identify deep fakes.
- Have complete ownership of their data (after coming to terms with the fact that you can't truly delete things from the Internet).
- Enjoy a custom wall designed and modified at will by AI. This includes custom layouts, custom algorithms, and the ability to connect to virtually any other social network.
- There will still be room for the commercial side of social networks, especially in providing infrastructure, particularly for celebrities, etc.
